# How to use react components?
There are two ways to use react components:
1. **Using the component directly**: You can import the component directly and use it in your code.
2. **Using the component as a template**: You can use the component as a template and pass the required props to it.

Note: We are using the templating method. e.g. ```<ComponentName prop1="value1" prop2="value2" />```.

Here is a [Dashboard Example](../components/dashboard/index.tsx) component that uses the templating.
