# Subject: Advanced Artificial Intelligence & Distributed and Enterprise Software Development, 10th Feburary - 1st May 2025.
### Topic: Portfolio
- Research Purpose: To understand the developments and implementations of memory management principles.

### Learning Outcomes
#### Advanced Artificial Intelligence (AAI) (100% of the Component):
- MO1: Evaluate distributed and parallel computing concepts and paradigms with their legal, ethical,
social and professional implications in developing large scale software systems.

- MO2: Describe and evaluate the concepts and paradigms of modern enterprise systems with particular
focus on components, interfaces and services.

- MO3: Apply a current industrial project management approach when undertaking a software
development project.

- MO4: Identify security issues in distributed or enterprise level software systems in order to implement preventive measures.

#### Distributed and Enterprise Software Development (DaESD) (60% of the Component):
- MO1: Critically appraise competing AI-based paradigms and algorithms in the context of the issues posed by particular problems.

- MO2: Select and tune appropriate state of the art machine learning and optimisation algorithms to realistic sized problems illustrating properties such as scale, noise, missing data.

- MO3: Synthesise, design, and implement appropriate hybrid systems blending different paradigms for complex problems.

- MO4: Demonstrate skills in evaluating systems and presenting findings in ways appropriate to different audiences.

### Notes:
#### Case study:
- The assessment for standard CS route is based on the case study detailed in the enclosed file, called **Case Study.docx**, as part of the bundle.

- Likewise, the assessment for AI route is based on the case study detailed in the file called **Case Study MLAAS.pdf**.

#### Assessment:
- Manage your group project with Agile methodology (Scrum-like, e.g. Scrumban).

- You will work through sprints starting from the forth (4th) week of Spring Term.

- You need to practice stand-up sessions each week during the practical sessions. This is going to be
part of the assessment.

- You will do the AI-based case study rather than the default one for DESD. All other aspects of the DaESD project and assessment are unchanged.

- The AI-based solution you develop should be deployable as a service with appropriate interfaces to be integrated into a wider system as required by DESD.

#### DaESD Marking Rubics:
- Overall group mark = (Sprint 1 + Sprint 2 + Sprint 3) (60%) + Software Performance (40%)
- Contribution = Peer Assessment (40%) + Stand-up performance (40%) + Tutor observation (20%)
- Individual Mark = Contribution x Overall Group Mark

### Deliverables
#### AAI Portfolio:
##### Video (20%. MO1 & MO4)
- A video called 'Executive Summary', with no more than 5 minutes duration discussing:
    - The potential benefits to the organisation.
    - Challenges presented by the problem characteristics.
    - Any ethical or legal concerns (such as transparency of decision making).

##### Demonstration (40%. MO2 & MO3)
- An in-class demonstration of the software solution produced, aimed at a more “AI-aware” audience.

##### Report (40% MO1, MO2, MO3 & MO4)
- Technical Report of no more than 2500 words (+10% policy).
    - This should be written in a style suitable for a more technical audience.
    - Report Structure:
        - Challenges presented by the problem characteristics.
        - Candidate approaches considered.
        - Design choices – such as choice of specific libraries/frameworks.
        - How you have used Generative AI throughout the project.
        - The design, implementation, testing and evaluation of the system.
        - Your approach to legal, ethical and profession issues such as data access, privacy, and “Fairness, Accountability and Trust”.

##### Software Code
- A Github repository of the source and test code.
